# Why I made this? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

I was thinking about making my own npm package/javascript library to help folks and developers to make their calculations easy. I googled and searched on YouTube and did some research on how to make my own npm package. And, then finally made a demo package and then I thought to create this one. This is my ***first npm package*** based on calculations.
